# Signal Processing & Input Filteration
SignalFilterComparison is a Python-based project designed to explore and compare the effectiveness of three types of filters: Low Pass (LPF), High Pass (HPF), and Band Pass (BPF). Through meticulously crafted scripts, the project implements each filter and convolves them with an input signal to generate filtered outputs. The core objective is to evaluate how well these filters approximate a given output signal, employing correlation analysis as the primary metric for comparison.

## Given to us

- Input File X(t) :  [Input](https://github.com/KaraNxKP007/Signal-Processing-Input-Filteration/blob/main/INPUT-SIGNAL-X(t).txt)
- Output signal  Y(t) : [Output](https://github.com/KaraNxKP007/Signal-Processing-Input-Filteration/blob/main/OUTPUT-SIGNAL-Y(t).txt)

  
## How does it work

The project workflow involves several key steps:

1. **Filter Implementation**: 

2. **Convolution with Input Signal**:

3. **Correlation Analysis**:

4. **Performance Evaluation**:

5. **Identification of Best Match**:

6. **Result Presentation**:
